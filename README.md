# DETECTING RICE LEAF DISEASES 
## INTRODUCTION:

Rice is by far the most significant food crop for people in low- and lower-middle-income nations, out of the three primary crops (rice, wheat, and maize). Although both rich and poor people eat rice in low-income nations, the poorest people consume comparatively little wheat and are thus heavily influenced by rice prices and availability.

Rice is a vital and often irreplaceable staple in many Asian countries, particularly among the impoverished. Rice accounts for about half of the food expenditures and a fifth of total family expenditures for Asia's extreme poor, who subsist on less than 1.25 per-day_on_average. This group alone spends 62 billion (in purchasing power parity) on rice each year. Rice is vital to the food security of many of the world's impoverished.

**We can see from the graph that the loss is decreasing and the accuracy is increasing with the increase in the epochs**

### MAKE A PREDICTION ON THE VAL SET

  ## CONCLUSION:
* We have used 25 images from bacterial blight,brown spot class and 24 from leaf smut class for training (104 training images)
* We have used 5 images from each class for validation (15 validation images)
* Created an image directory
* Fine tuned a MobileNet model that was pre-trained on imagenet.
* Used Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss and a constant learning rate of 0.0001
* We have used callbacks such as EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint,LearningRateScheduler
* We didn't use the pre-processing method that was applied to the imagenet images that were used to pre-train Mobilenet. Instead we normalized all images by dividing by 255.
* Performed image augmentation using the Albumentations library. Image augmentation helped to reduce overfitting, improved our model performance and helped the model to generalize better.
We predicted the random images from Google to check the working of our model
